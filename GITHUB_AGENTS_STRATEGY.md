## 📊 CAPACITY MATH

**Your toolkit can handle:**
- ✅ 3-4 concurrent tasks (Cursor + Comet + Copilot agents)
- ✅ 10-15 code edits per day (Cursor speed)
- ✅ 5-10 comprehensive audits per day (Copilot agents)
- ✅ Multiple PR reviews simultaneously (GitHub)
- ✅ Real-time deployment pipeline (Vercel)

**Combined throughput:** 50-100x faster than solo development

## 🎓 BEST PRACTICES WITH YOUR TOOLKIT

### ✅ DO THIS:

1. **Leverage Parallelization**
   - Cursor works on Fix A
   - Copilot agents work on Tasks B, C, D
   - You review PRs from agents
   - Comet handles architectural discussion
   - All happening simultaneously

2. **Keep Communication Clear**
   - GitHub issues are your task specifications
   - Comments coordinate between tools
   - Perplexity orchestrates overall flow
   - You make final decisions

3. **Test Before Pushing**
   - Cursor tests locally
   - Vercel validates in CI
   - You spot-check production
   - Rollback if needed

4. **Document Everything**
   - Commit messages explain why
   - Issues track decisions
   - Status files stay current
   - Knowledge is preserved

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:

- ❌ Have all tools working on same code (merge conflicts)
- ❌ Push without GitHub workflow (loses coordination)
- ❌ Skip Cursor testing (breaks builds)
- ❌ Ignore Vercel feedback (production issues)
- ❌ Forget to update documentation
