# Netlify Redirects for SPA (Single Page Application)
# Documentation: https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

# Redirect all requests to index.html for client-side routing (React Router)
# This allows React Router to handle all routes instead of Netlify returning 404s
# The 200 status code is a "rewrite" - it serves index.html but keeps the original URL

# Exclude source files (shouldn't exist in production, return 404)
# This prevents the SPA fallback from serving index.html for /src/* requests
# which would cause MIME type errors (expecting JavaScript, got HTML)
/src/*    /404.html    404

# SPA fallback - redirect everything else to index.html
/*    /index.html    200

# Note: This is also configured in netlify.toml as a backup.
# Having it in both places ensures SPA routing works correctly.

# Future: Add specific redirects here if needed
# Example: Redirect old URLs to new ones
# /old-path    /new-path    301

# Example: Proxy API requests to an external service
# /api/*    https://api.example.com/:splat    200
